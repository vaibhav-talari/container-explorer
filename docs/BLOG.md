# What are Virtual Machines?

- Applications are generally deployed in a virtual machine.
- A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.
- Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host.

# What are Containers?

Containers are a technology that allows applications to be packaged and isolated with their entire runtime environment.

# Why use Containers?

- The computational overhead spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial.
- They make it easier to maintain consistent behavior and functionality while moving the contained application between environments.
- Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies.
